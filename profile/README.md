# Freely-Given.org

Freely-Given.org is dedicated to creating, curating, converting, and serving **open-licensed
Biblical resources and software** that can be freely used by anyone in the world
wanting to investigate the Bible for themselves
and/or provide such services to others.

Our website is https://Freely-Given.org, established in 2010.

## Contributing

We welcome several kinds of help:

- Assistance in compiling datasets
- Using and checking datasets, and reporting errors that need fixing, or improvements that can be added
- Software developers to improve our proof-of-concept apps and APIs

## Specific projects

- [BibleBooksCodes](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/BibleBooksCodes): An extensive set of three-character consistently-defined codes (like *GEN* and *TH2*) that can be used by computer software to label particular Bible "books" and letters. They're also referenced against the OSIS and USFM Bible book codes, among others. (Note that the codes all start with an UPPERCASE letter, so unlike most other systems, they can also be used as variable names in most computer languages.) The dataset also includes sample implementations in some common computer languages.
- [BibleVersionCodes](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/BibleVersionCodes): A list of short Bible abbreviations (like *ASV* and *NIV* and sometimes including extended versions like *NIV-1984*). This repository is intended to be a registry that any Bible publisher can request additions to. The dataset also includes sample implementations in some common computer languages.
- [BibleOrgSys](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/BibleOrgSys): The Bible Organisational System is a Python library that reads, processes, and writes many kinds of B/C/V

## Forthcoming projects

- [Biblelastic](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/Biblelastic): A planned "fantastic" Bible study app. Designers and coders wanted.
